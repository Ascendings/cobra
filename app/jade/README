Hey guys!

This is just a directory for jade files.
You can compile the files here to views to app/views
	Files here organized are to match their respective directory (ex: jade/home/index.jade matches views/home/index.html)

If you don't want jade, just delete this directory (jade/) and be on with yourself.

If you would like to mix PHP and jade, you'll have to work on your own for that! ;)
