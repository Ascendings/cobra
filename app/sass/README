Sup, homies?

This is just a directory for sass files.
You can compile the files here to views to public/css
	Files here organized are to match their respective directory (ex: sass/main.sass matches public/css/main.css)

If you don't want sass, just delete this directory (sass/) and be on with yourself.

I know some people like SCSS instead of SASS. Just use .scss files instead, you'll be fine! ;)
