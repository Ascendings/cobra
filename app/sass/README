Sup, homies?

This is just a directory for sass files.
You can compile the files here to views to public/css
main.sass is meant to be the sass file that is loaded by web pages (public/css/main.css). Compile this how you wish.

If you don't want sass, just delete this directory (sass/) and be on with yourself.

I know some people like SCSS instead of SASS. Just use .scss files instead, you'll be fine! ;)
