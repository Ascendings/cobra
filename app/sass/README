Sup, homies?

This is just a directory for sass files.
You can compile the files here to views to public/css
Files here are organized to match their respective directory (ex: sass/main.sass matches public/css/main.css)
By the way, I highly recommend you install bourbon, if you're going to continue with sass! It's friggin' amazing, and its mixins are extremely useful.

If you don't want sass, just delete this directory (sass/) and be on with yourself.

I know some people like SCSS instead of SASS. Just use .scss files instead, you'll be fine! ;)
