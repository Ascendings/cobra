Short and quick PHP MVC site skeleton. 

This is just the skeleton I generally use when I create my own PHP applications. I put this up so I can easily pull down a new copy of the skeleton when I need it.
Everyone is free to use this and mess with it.

I got a lot of the foundation from PHP Academy's How to build a PHP MVC application tutorial series.
