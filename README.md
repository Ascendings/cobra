Short and quick PHP MVC site skeleton. 

This is just the skeleton I generally use when I create my own PHP applications. I put this up so I can easily pull down a new copy of the skeleton when I need it.
Everyone is free to use this and mess with it.

This project contains a folder for sass (scss) files. You may get rid of this as you wish, it really doesn't matter to me, and your project will still work regardless. I'm just not caught up in the stone ages of web development, is all ;)

I got a lot of the foundation from PHP Academy's How to build a PHP MVC application tutorial series.
